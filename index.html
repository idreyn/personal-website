        <p>My mother is from the Twin Cities and my father was from Boston. I consider both places my home, and
            spent my
            first few decades rather evenly between them. I studied computer science and electrical engineering at
            MIT
            and I
            currently live in — yep — Brooklyn.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I am serializing a “DMT-core dark academia” science fiction novel called <a
                        href="https://mirrorsea.xyz" target="_blank"><i>Upon the Mirror Sea</i></a>. It's about
                    psychedelics, surveillance, and first contact with the creatures living in the space between our
                    minds.
                    You can read the work in progress now.</li>
                <li>I am co-lead of the <a href="https://transitmatters.org/transitmatters-labs"
                        target="_blank">TransitMatters Labs team</a>. We build tools to help the public, the press, and
                    policymakers understand the state of Boston's transit system, and how it could be better. I'm
                    especially
                    proud of the <a href="https://regionalrail.rocks" target="_blank">Regional Rail Explorer</a>.</li>
                <li><b>I am looking for work</b> after taking extended time off to focus on the above. I am open to
                    software
                    engineering roles that are either remote or based in New York City.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>From <b>2019-2023</b> I was a senior software engineer at the <a
                        href="https://www.knowledgefutures.org/" target="_blank">Knowledge Futures Group</a>, building
                    an
                    academic
                    publishing
                    platform called <a href="https://www.pubpub.org" target="_blank">PubPub</a>. I did deep and
                    cross-functional work on
                    content management, in-browser rich text
                    editing,
                    and healthier tools for collaborative knowledge production.</li>
                <li>From <b>2017-2019</b> I was a software engineer at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"
                        target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>, where I worked on onboarding
                    experiences
                    and tools for
                    classrooms.</li>
                <li>From <b>2016-2019</b> I occasionally published a blog about transit called <a
                        href="https://yelling-at-trains.org" target="_blank">Yelling at Trains</a>.</li>
                <li>From <b>2015-2017</b> (and again in 2020-2021) I prototyped a wearable assistive device for human
                    echolocation with
                    collaborators at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT CSAIL</a> and the <a
                        href="https://www.ski.org/" target="_blank">Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute</a>.</li>
                <li>From <b>2013-2014</b> I was an undergraduate researcher at the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the
                    MIT
                    Media
                    Lab, working
                    on Scratch. Before that, I was a volunteer moderator for the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu"
                        target="_blank">scratch.mit.edu</a> platform.

                <li>I have an abiding love for the Web as a platform and a gathering place. I am in awe of its dynamic
                    range:
                    simple
                    to complex, frustrating to empowering, coercive to liberating. I expect to hear rumors of its
                    impending
                    demise for
                    the rest of my life.</li>
                <li>I want American cities to be healthier and more affordable to live in. I'm most interested in public
                    transit, but
                    I also love learning about housing policy, social services, urban ecology, and all the other levers
                    we
                    can
                    pull on
                    to make our cities better.</li>
                <li>I am a gradually more avid birdwatcher. I harbor suspicion that the genus <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae" target="_blank">Cordivae</a> is secretly the
                    dominant
                    life
                    form on this planet.</li>
