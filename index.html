        <p>My mother is from the Twin Cities and my father was from Boston. I consider both places my home, and
            spent my
            first few decades rather evenly between them. I studied computer science and electrical engineering at
            MIT
            and I
            currently live in, yep, Brooklyn.</p>

                <li>Since <b>2023</b> I have been serializing a “DMT-core dark academia” science fiction novel called <a
                        href="https://mirrorsea.xyz"><i>Upon the Mirror Sea</i></a>. It's about
                    psychedelics, surveillance, and first contact with the creatures living in the space between our
                    minds.
                    It's nearly complete; you can read the work in progress now.</li>
                <li>In <b>2023</b> I prototyped a wearable assistive device for
                    human
                    echolocation with
                    collaborators at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL</a> and the <a
                        href="https://www.ski.org/">Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute</a>. Our paper on the work
                    is forthcoming for <a href="https://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/sessions/">CSUN 2024</a>.</li>
                <li>I am a volunteer with the <a href="https://transitmatters.org/transitmatters-labs">TransitMatters

                        Mueller</a>). We build tools to help the public, the
                    press, and
                    policymakers understand the state of Boston's transit system, and how it could be better. Check out

            <ul>
                <li>From <b>2019-2023</b> I was a senior software engineer at the <a
                        href="https://www.knowledgefutures.org/">Knowledge Futures Group</a>, building
                    an

                    publishing
                    platform called <a href="https://www.pubpub.org">PubPub</a>. I did deep and
                    cross-functional work on
                    content management, in-browser rich text
                    editing,
                    and healthier tools for collaborative knowledge production.</li>
                <li>From <b>2017-2019</b> I was a software engineer at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan
                        Academy</a>, where I worked on onboarding
                    experiences
                    and tools for
                    classrooms.</li>
                <li>From <b>2016-2019</b> I occasionally published a blog about transit called <a
                        href="https://yelling-at-trains.org">Yelling at Trains</a>.</li>
                <li>From <b>2013-2014</b> I was an undergraduate researcher at the Lifelong Kindergarten group at
                    the
                    MIT
                    Media
                    Lab, working
                    on Scratch. Before that, I was a volunteer moderator for the <a

                <li>I have an abiding love for the Web as a platform and a gathering place. I am in awe of its
                    dynamic
                    range:
                    simple
                    to complex, frustrating to empowering, coercive to liberating. I expect to hear rumors of its
                    impending
                    demise for
                    the rest of my life.</li>
                <li>I want American cities to be healthier and more affordable to live in. I'm most interested in
                    public
                    transit, but
                    I also love learning about housing policy, social services, urban ecology, and all the other
                    levers
                    we
                    can
                    pull on
                    to make our cities better.</li>
                <li>I am a gradually more avid birdwatcher. I harbor suspicion that the genus <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae">Corvidae</a> is secretly the
                    dominant
                    life
                    form on this planet.</li>
                <li>I aim to surprise, delight, and provide for the people around me.</li>
